If you have redo installed (http://github.com/apenwarr/redo) then you can build tcc and run the tests by typing

    redo

from the project root directory. If not, you can build tcc by typing

    ./do bin/tcc

but this does not support incremental builds. You may then run the tests by
typing

    prove -l
